Unity Platform Overview
====================

A Model Driven Approach
---------------------

### Technology changes every 6 months... mobile technology can change even faster

We have many challenges when developing mobile applications

* Develop, Distribute and Maintain for multiple platforms
* There's a high cost developing these applications and an even higher cost maintaining them
* Our clients need applications on one device today, but tomorrow he needs the same application on a different device...
* There is no convergence in the mobile market
* We have to decide our target market; we can't support them all in a sustainable manner... or can we?

### So... we work with a "Model" device and not a specific device in mind!

* We work with a "model" device that offers a set of features; it should have:
    * Ability to be used as a conventional phone
    * Seamless connectivity to the internet (3G/WiFi/Etc)
    * Support for a rich internet browser
    * A large colour display and Input mechanisms allowing full-text entry
    * Personal Information Management (Contacts and Calendar)
    * Embedded GPS peripherals for geo-location
    * Camera and Media support (Capture and Playback)
    * A powerful processor to allow for some business processes to be carried out on the device
    * Local storage capacity: files & databases
* We can contemplate applications that make use of the "model" functionalities; we will worry about "specific" implementations at a later phase
